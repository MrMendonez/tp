            The purpose of Trusting Pixels is to represent people as they are. This means we keep all bodily features as close to the original state it was captured on camera. Our focus is to prioritize the image of people truthfully, rather than being the second thought behind the products or services advertised.<br />
            <br />
            Any content that is distributed by Trusting Pixels Inc. from May 31st, 2016 to January 31st, 2016 abides our beta phase regulations which are as follows:<br />
            <br />
            1. No adjustments can be made to the shape/size of a personâ€™s body/features. For example, changing shape of someone nose, chest size, waist size is not permitted.</br />
            <br />
            2. No selective grading. We do not allow selective grading to enhance bodily features.<br />
            <br />
            3. We allow content to be graded and have colored filters.<br />
            <br />
            *Trusting Pixels will be in its beta phase until the end of 2016. After our beta term we will re-
            assess our regulations and provide an update for our following year of production on our website for the public and clients to view.
