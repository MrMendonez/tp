            We work with brands (and agencies representing brands) to monitor their production from start to finish to ensure that their final advertisement contains people free of alterations.  Our team gathers the orignal content (photos and video) which we then carefully compare to their final image to ensure no adjustments were made.<br />
            <br />
            Every adjustment we work on is then distributed on our Instagram and Facebook social media pages for the public to see. This gives the public a platform to visit where people are advertised as people and not as products.<br />
            <br />
